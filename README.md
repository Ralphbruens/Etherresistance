## Artefact

This artifact is a collection of information about pirate radio which is very interesting as an artifact for transcoding. This publication was released because it became much more difficult to set up an pirate station. This publication contains story of successful and unsuccessful stations and how can we learn form this for future pirate radio.

<!-- You should include a short introduction about your artefact here. Keep in mind: there is space in the metadata (below) to include the 'formal' or 'physical' description. In your [Research](#Research-h1) section (even lower below) you can expand on the context, history and relevant information for the audience. This little introduction here should have a short, overview quality. Just enough to give a clear overview, before getting into details.   -->

The cover is glossy with a image of a screaming human and an arm of an other person with a microphone. The background is filled gray skyscrapers. The title "Radio is my Bomb" is placed in the left corner and on the bottom you see the subtitle "DIY Manual for Pirates". The back of the cover is decorated with a red and black pattern and a white column with a small discription of the content.

## Research

### The Artefact
A pirate radio how-to guide published by Hooligan Press in London in April, 1987. The title comes from a quote from Chantal Paternostre, a Belgian anarchist who said it when arrested on trumped up terrorism charges. She worked for Radio Air Libre, a Brussels pirate radio station. She was eventually released from prison after more than a year detained: most of it in solitary confinement.
<sup>[[1]](#footnote-1)</sup>

### Pirate Radio
Since this subject covers national territories, international water and international airspace, the only effective way to treat this subject is on a country by country, international waters and international airspace basis. Because the laws vary, the interpretation of the term pirate radio also varies considerably

Illegal use of licensed radio spectrum in several forms: Unlicensed operation, Inadvertent interference, Deliberate or malicious interference, Illegal equipment.

> If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, and only one person were of the opposite opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.
>
> A Liberal defense of free speech by John Stuart Mill

### Offshore

> There is a value to act local. Create a (physical) network between different stations to provide and produce material for radio.

Offshore radio is radio broadcasting from ships or fixed maritime structures. Offshore broadcasters are usually unlicenced but transmissions are legal in international waters. This is in contrast to broadcasting without a licence on land or within a nation's territorial waters, which is usually unlawful.

## In contemporary context
### Piracy

The term piracy more generally designated the unauthorized usage or reproduction of copyright or patent-protected material. This is almost a far cry from the word’s original etymology. <sup>[[3]](#footnote-3)</sup>

Encryption, Open Sources, Download/Upload (Piratebay, MEGA etc)

### Sneaker-net

Disappointed with the limitations of digital data transport, we turned to analogue transportation. Before digital networks, information was transported between two computers by simply using a floppy disk. This method of carrying digital information in an analogue way is called a ‘sneakernet’. Used in Burma in 2000 to smuggle data out of the country, it has been used for secure transportation of data. We chose to transport the data through sneaker net We knew people that travelled between the west and Iran, and we could use mobile devices to bring the stories back. All we had to do was to create an application capable of recording our stories with a relative safety. <sup>[[4]](#footnote-4)</sup>

## Transcoding
The artifact has some important messages. For example about the freedom of speech, social movements and human rights. The content is maybe old but still valuable. Transcoding this artifact can result that the content and visuals can last longer in a contemporary context.

### Concepts
<details>
    
**Digitizing: scanning the publication.**

We can digitizing. But much in the text has been superseded by modern technology. So if we reproduce it for reference only. And how to preserve the digital data?

**Audio:**
Using the techniques inside the publication to make a physchial reproduction of the Diy Manual which send out audio/produce audio.

**Video:**
Using video as a tool to make DIY Instructions. It's a contemporary way of communicating.

**Translate to Instruction (Again)**  
Making an instruction for translation or recreation. A system that flexible to make for continuous refreshment. A linguistic solution. But after year do we still speak the same language and how to preserve the instruction?

**Make an online forum**
Make a platform for people sharing their thoughts on making your own (pirate)Radio but also about sharing the infromation of Part one of the artifact.

### 01 Platform
#### Description
LAB is a trans-departmental platfrom to research, transcoding and develope idea's in the frame of (public) distribution, independent broadcasting and network piracy.

 |                |             |    
 | ------------- |-------------|
 | Why | The artifact is outdated, both physical and content. Also relevant to the context of public distrbution and community |
 | What |  A (digital) publication with updated content. |
 | How | Website / Own media server |


### Methods
<details>
First step in making an platform started with the idea of making YouTube video. The instruction from the artifact fit well with the idea of Online DIY video.

##### A youtube channel

##### Website
Because signing up fro youtube means, you sell your soul to google. That's why I decide to make my own platform/website.

##### Server
Create an own platform means that it also need a server to be online. That's the moment I create my own media server with the raspberry pi.

 <sub> The webserver & Terminal screen for intalling the webserver </sub>

 To access the server on the raspberry pi I installed Raspbian and Apache2 on the SD card.

 Then I had to install SSH file to access the server via Cyberduck.
Now I change the index.html file.

## Reflection

While working on this project, the transcoding was done in different circles. From small sketches suchs as a mini FM Radio to analogue try-outs like tie-dye textile. The process was quite organic, and research and transcoding made it clear that a website with a visual identity could be the right medium for everything to come together. Using a local server was also a nice addition.

## Conclusion
I enjoyed the project. From research through the archive and finding interesting material; to turn an artefact inside and out. With this project, I tried to point out the relevancy of ether resistance and that even radio is an old media there are ways to adapt the thinking of the pirates in contemporary media and to encourge people to the same, just like the orignal artefact.
